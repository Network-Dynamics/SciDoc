Documentation for |package|
*****************************

|package| consists of a python mocule named |mainmod|, and a frontend program named |mainprog|.
|mainmod| contains functions that can parse a text of certain formats (|formatsup| for now), analyze the text using user-definable rules. |mainmod| is modular, making it very easy to add your own rules in the form of handler functions.
