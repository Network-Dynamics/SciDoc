Preface
Piecewise smooth dynamical systems are of particular interest because of their
ubiquity and the plethora of novel behaviours they exhibit. There are very elegant existing frameworks for analyzing different kinds of border collision bifurcations occurring in those systems. These include the classic work on border
collision of equilibria by Feigin [1], analysis of grazing bifurcations using the
ZDM (Zero-time Discontinuity Mapping) formalism developed by Nordmark
et al. [2] and the impact map approach developed by Bernardo et al. [3, p. 10].
Using the ZDM formalism, Banerjee and Kundu analyzed the soft impacting oscillator system and predicted the onset of chaos immediately following
the grazing of a limit cycle except when the ratio of the damped natural frequency of the system and the forcing function frequency are in integral or half
integral ratios. Experiments have roughly borne out this prediction, except for
the fact that chaos has been observed to vanish in a small neighbourhood of those
values predicted analytically. Here we have used the impact map formalism
to derive the necessary conditions for chaos to vanish and matched the results
with the experimental results.
It has been reported previously that the lifetimes of transients in systems
exhibiting grazing bifurcations follow a power law pattern as the parameter
value approaches the grazing value. We have observed the same characteristics
in a simple harmonic oscillator with hard impacts. We found that the transient
lifetimes were orders of magnitude larger than what they should have been
if the impacts did not occur. We have attempted to explain this behaviour by
defining a quantity which represents how likely is a system to undergo impacts
for a set of parameter values.

Introduction
1.1

Overview

Theory of dynamical systems enables us to gain valuable insights into many
problems. By using the powerful tools it provides, in many cases we can explain how a system will behave when the actual equations governing its evolution are too difficult to solve analytically. This approach has been proved
time and again to be extremely useful in a diverse range of areas: fluid flows,
electrical circuits, ecological systems etc.
However, conventional treatments of the subject generally places the demand that the systems be describable in terms of smooth functions of the dynamical variables. There are valid reasons for doing so. For a system’s stability
analysis, the Jacobian plays a role of paramount importance. But its existence
cannot be guaranteed everywhere in the phase space for non smooth systems.
Figure 1.1: Trajectory of a bouncing ball : a piecewise smooth system

Unfortunately, many systems we need to deal with regularly are piecewise
smooth: switching circuits in power electronics [4], walking robots [5], systems
exhibiting sliding or chattering motion [6, 7], impact print hammers [8, 9] etc.
One subclass of these systems is called piecewise smooth systems. The equation
governing the evolution of these system changes the moment the system coordinates cross what is known as a “switching manifold”, which is a surface
1

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

with dimension lower than that of the phase space. Between any two of those
switches, the system evolves smoothly.
For example, a ball bouncing against the floor under the influence of gravity
constitutes such a system. Between any two bounces, the height of the ball h is
¨ = − g/m, where g is the acceleration due to gravity and m is the
described by h
mass of the ball. The solution to the equation is a parabola, as depicted in Fig
1.1, which is of course a smooth function. But at the instance of the bounce, the
velocity of the ball changes changes in a non-smooth manner. Despite the simplicity of the system, it shows rich dynamical behaviour for certain parameter
values [10].

1.2.1

Classification of piecewise smooth systems
Piecewise smooth maps

Definition 1.2.1. A map described by a finite set of smooth maps:
x → Fi ( x, µ) ∀ x ∈ Si

(1.1)

is called a piecewise smooth map if:
1.
Si
∪ i Si
Si ∩ S j

∈ X
= X
= ∅,

∀i
i=j

(X being the phase space of the system)
2. Each of the functions Fi is smooth in both the state x and the parameter µ
throughout Si .
Example: Tent map

x n +1 = f µ ( x n ) =



µxn



µ (1 − x n )

for xn <

1

(1.2)
for

≤ xn

Now we will define a few quantities to be used extensively in the next sections.
Definition 1.2.2. The intersection Σij between the closures (i.e. the set and its limit
points) of any pair of Si ’s are called the switching manifolds of the system:
¯i ∪ S
¯j
Σij := S

Example: In case of the Tent map (1.2), there is one switching manifold consisting of a single point: Σ12 = {1/2}.
Definition 1.2.3. For a point x0 ∈ σij , the leading order term in the power series
expansion of Fi ( x ) − Fj ( x ) about x0 is called the order of singularity of the map at
the point x0 .
Example:

In case of tent map,
F2 ( x ) − F1 ( x ) = 2µx − µ
1
= 0 + 2µ( x − )
2

(1.3)
(1.4)

Therefore the order of singularity is 1.
It is obvious that if the map has a discontinuity at a point, the order of singularity at that point will be 0.
We will later see that piecewise smooth maps arise naturally as a result of
taking Poincaré sections of piecewise smooth flows (Something we will define
right now).

1.2.2

Piecewise smooth flows

Piecewise smooth flows are defined by extending the concept of piecewise
smooth maps to continuous time systems:

3. Each of the vector fields Fi admits a solution ϕi ( x ):

that is smooth in both the state x and the parameter µ throughout Si .

1.3

Bifurcations in piecewise smooth systems

Piecewise smooth dynamical systems, quite naturally, can show all the usual
types of dynamical behaviour shown by smooth dynamical systems : period
doubling [11, p. 166-170] bifurcations, saddle-node [11, p. 109] bifurcations etc.
However, piecewise smooth systems exhibit a plethora of interesting behaviours which involve the sudden change in the system dynamics at the switching manifolds and hence, which are not possible in smooth systems. An extensive mathematical framework to study these behaviours was first published in
the Russian literature as early as the seventies of the last century by Mark Feigin [1, 12, 13]. Then these types of behaviours were named C-bifurcations. Now
they also go by the name of border collision bifurcations. Examples include border collision of equilibria [1], grazing bifurcation of limit cycles [14] and sliding bifurcations [15,16]. We will briefly review a few of these novel behaviours
now.

Border collision of equilibria

Consider a piecewise smooth map:
˙ =
x

F1 (x)
F2 (x)

: H (x) < 0
: H (x) > 0

(1.12)

Where H ( x ) = 0 defines the switching manifold:
S1 = { x : H ( x ) < 0 }
S2 = { x : H ( x ) ≥ 0 }
Suppose there exists an equilibrium point of the piecewise smooth system
∗ ( µ ) in the region S of the phase space:
x1
1
∗
F1 ( x1
(µ)) = 0

Now, as the parameter µ is changed, this equilibrium point will, in general, move in the phase space. Sometimes it may happen that for parameter
∗ ( µ ) crosses the boundary and lands up in the revalues µ > µ0 this point x1
˙ = F1 ( x ) is not the correct ODE in the first place!
gion S2 . But in that region x
∗ ( µ ) is no longer a fixed point. We call it a virtual fixed point of
Therefore x1
the system and such a phenomenon is called “border collision of equilibrium”.
This phenomenon was first studied by Marc Feigin in case of discrete time systems [17](later extended by Bernardo et al. to continuous time systems [18])
where he classified the dynamical behaviours that can take place when equilibria crosses the switching manifold and derived the necessary conditions for
each of them in terms of the eigenvalues of the Jacobians at both sides of the
switching manifold. We will now briefly discuss this approach.
Types of border collision of equilibria
Consider a piecewise smooth flow described by (1.12). Let’s switch to a coordinate system such that the equations of motion look like:
˙ =
x

F1 (x, µ)
F2 (x, µ)

: xn < 0
: xn ≥ 0

(1.13)

(Where xn denotes the n-th component of x.) This can always be done, as
explained in [19]. Suppose that for every value of the parameter µ, ∃ two fixed
points of the flow, one in each side of the switching manifold:
∗
F1 (x∗
1 , µ ) = 0, x1 n ≤ 0

(1.14)

(1.15)

F2 (x∗

We can also assume without loss of generality that the border collision takes
place for the parameter value µ = 0 at the point x = 0:
∗
x∗
1 = x2 = 0 if µ = 0

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

Then we can locally linearize the map:
A1 x + Bµ
A2 x + Bµ

˙ =

: xn < 0
: xn < 0

Where:

and

∂F2

µ =0

(Assuming the flow to be continuous at x = 0).
Also, A1 and A2 can differ only in the n−th column (Again due to continuity, this time at µ = 0).
Now (1.14) becomes:
A1 x ∗
1 + B¯ = 0

(1.16)

Period doubling at border collision of equilibria
Sometimes it may happen that after a fixed point undergoes border collision,
a period-2 orbit emerges. This phenomenon was also studied in great detail
by [17]. Here we discuss in brief a very important necessary condition for this
to happen.
Claim 1.3.1. Consider a piecewise smooth map of the form (1.1):


 f 1 ( xn , µ) for xn < 0
x n +1 = f ( x n , µ ) =


f 2 ( xn , µ) for xn ≥ 0

(1.21)

∗ < 0 so long as the parameter µ < 0. Suppose
Suppose ∃ a fixed point of the map x1
∗
that when µ equals 0, x1 suffers border collision and increasing µ further, a perioddoubling bifurcation occurs. Then the Jacobian of the map must suffer a discontinuity
at 0, the point of border collision at the parameter value µ = 0

Proof. Here we will consider the 1-dimensional case. A period doubling bifurcation occurs if on changing the parameter value of a system,
1. The fixed point of the first composition of the map either no longer exists
or loses stability.
2. A fixed point in the second composition of the map either gets created or
becomes stable.
Suppose that after border collision, this period-2 orbit is now stable:
f 1 ( x1 ) = x2 , x1 < 0
f 2 ( x2 ) = x1
For stability, the derivative of the second composition must be less than 1
in magnitude:
d
f 2 ( f 1 ( x1 )) < 1
dx
f 1 ( x1 ) f 2 ( x2 ) < 1
Now, immediately after border collision, 0 < µ
1, the period-2 orbit will
be very close to the original period-1 fixed point: −1
x1 < 0, 0 < x2
1.
Therefore
f 1 (0) f 2 (0) < 1
Now, supposing the Jacobian suffers no discontinuity, this condition can be
satisfied only if:
(1.22)
f 1 (0) < 1, f 2 (0) < 1
But if that is the case, then the fixed point of the first composition of the
map (which was an attractor before the border collision and since the map is
assumed to be continuous in the parameter µ, is still in a neighbourhood of
0), is still an attractor. But this contradicts the necessary condition for a period
doubling bifurcation (i.e. the fixed point of the first composition must lose
stability). Therefore condition (1.22) can only be satisfied if the Jacobian suffers
a discontinuity at border collision.
For a more general proof applicable for systems of any dimensionality,
please refer to [17, 18].

1.3.2

Grazing bifurcation of limit cycles due to border collision

The phenomenon of a limit cycle grazing the switching manifold of a system is
encountered very frequently. These systems have been studied extensively by
Dankowicz and Nordmark [20], Bernardo et al. [14], Banerjee and Kundu [21]
etc.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

12

Consider a piecewise smooth flow as defined in (1.5):
˙=
x

F1 ( x )
F2 ( x )

∀ H (x) ≤ 0
∀ H (x) > 0

(1.23)

Suppose there exists an orbit (henceforth assumed to be period-1, for sake of
simplicity) which grazes against the switching manifold defined by the equation H ( x ) = 0 at a point 0. By construction, H (0) = 0. Now we’d like to know
how initial conditions starting very close to this stable grazing orbit behave.
There exists a very powerful method of analyzing the stability of closed orbits
of flows which goes like this:
1. Take a Poincaré section, which is basically a plane P with dimensionality
1 less than that of the phase space. Especially in case of systems driven
by an external periodic force with time period T, this section is generally taken by looking at the system at t = nT (the so-called stroboscopic
Poincaré section). Suppose the closed orbit intersects this Poincaré plane
at a point x0 .
2. Now choose a point x1 very close to x0 and see where it lands up on the
Poincaré plane after time T. This will define a so-called Poincaré map
Π:P→P
3. By construction, x0 is a fixed point of the map Π. Hence it can be locally
linearized:
Π( x ) − x0 ≈ J ( x0 )( x − x0 )
Where J =

∂Π
∂x .

4. The eigenvalues of the Jacobian determine the stability of the grazing orbit. If all the eigenvalues are < 1 is magnitude then it is stable, otherwise
not.
As depicted in Fig 1.8, when grazing takes place, certain initial conditions
close to the grazing orbit give rise to non-impacting orbits and others give rise
to impacting orbits.
Let a very important fact be noted here: The Poincaré map derived from a
piecewise smooth flow will be a piecewise smooth map: the switching manifold being
the collection of points x ∗ ∈ P such that orbits starting from them grazes the
switching manifold of the actual flow.
As we showed in Claim 1.3.1, the Jacobian so obtained will have to be discontinuous across the switching manifold for a period doubling cascade to take
place after grazing.
In the next section we will discuss a way of obtaining the Poincaré map Π
for piecewise smooth flows: the ZDM method.

ZDM

Consider the piecewise smooth flows defined by (1.12).Suppose there exists a
grazing orbit in the region H ( x ) > 0 that grazes the switching manifold at
the point x = 0. We impose the following restrictions on the system and the
grazing orbit:
1. H (0) = 0 (A necessary condition for x = 0 to be a grazing point).
2.

t=0 > 0 (Ensuring that H ( x ) attains a minimum

value for any orbits close to 0, another property to be used later.)

Consider an orbit starting from a point xi which is close to a grazing orbit
(See Fig 1.9). Suppose the orbit spends time δ0 to hit the switching manifold at
the point x1 , then it evolves according to the second vector field F2 . After time
δ, it reaches the point with minimum H, an occurrence guaranteed by property
4. After time δ , it hits the switching manifold again at point x2
The ZDM is defined as a map which maps xi to a point x3 in zero time such
the time taken to go from xi to x2 equals the time it would have taken to go from
1 ϕ
˙ i ( x, t)|t=0 = Fi ( x ). ϕi ( x, t) denotes an orbit satisfying the corresponding ODE starting from
the initial co-ordinate x at t = 0.

case of a more genaral class of maps called discontinuity mappings [14, 22–24].
From Fig 1.9, it is evident that
ZDM ( xi ) = ϕ1 (−δ0 − δ − δ , x2 )
The advantage of the ZDM formalism is that any orbit starting from the
point xi at time 0 and ending at a point x f at time t, both in the region H ( x ) > 0
and involving a single foray into the ‘other’ side side of the flow can be written
as:
x f = ϕ1 ( ZDM( xi ), t)
(1.24)
without worrying about Flow 2. Of course, the information regarding the
time spent by the system according to Flow 2 is still there: it is hidden in the
ZDM. As we will see in the next subsection, provided the orbit is close to grazing, ZDM can be derived analytically.
In particular, ZDM approach enables one to calculate the stroboscopic Poincaré
maps for orbits shown in Fig 1.8:
Π( xi ) = ϕ1 (( ZDM ( ϕ1 ( xi , τ0 )), T − τ0 )

(1.25)

after which stability analysis becomes possible using the usual method of
calculating the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of Π at the fixed point.

1.4.2

Vanishing chaos

Impact oscillators as described in (1.7) and (1.10) have been studied extensively
since the 1970’s when Feigin [1] described their bifurcation structure. We now
know that they can exhibit extremely rich dynamical behaviour. Using the
ZDM approach, Banerjee et al. investigated the grazing bifurcations in such
systems [21, 25–28] . They found that the Jacobian suffers a discontinuity at
grazing (which, as we showed in Claim 1.3.1, is a necessary condition for period doubling bifurcation at grazing) unless the damped natural frequency of
the system is an integral multiple of half the frequency of the external driving

This implies that chaos initiated by a period doubling cascade cannot take
place at those specific n-values. Now we will describe their method.

The system is depicted in Fig 1.10. It consists of a mass m attached to a

mass being externally driven by a force G (t) = F cos ωt. There is a massless
strip of wood attached to a spring of spring constant k2 at a distance σ from
the equilibrium position of the first spring. The second spring is pre-stressed
so that it is already compressed by an amount d. The equations of motion are:

At suitable parameter values, there will be grazing and impacting orbits as
depicted in Fig 1.8. In that case, we can analyze the system dynamics in terms
of a Poincaré map taking the form:
Π = N2 ◦ ZDM ◦ N1

(1.30)

Where N1 is a state transition matrix that takes a point xi on the Poincaré
plane to the switching manifold and N2 is the state transition matrix that takes
the result of applying the ZDM back to the Poincaré plane.
N1 and N2 can be obtained from the solution of the driven SHO, which can
be analytically solved. So ZDM is the only tricky part.

Calculating the Jacobian of the Poincaré map For orbits close to grazing, the
total Poincaré map would be given by (1.30). Therefore the Jacobian J of the

that the Jacobian of the ZDM will have a singularity at grazing. This singularity
will be seen to be the root of the discontinuity in the Jacobian, which in turn,
will cause the period doubling cascade.

Now we are in a position to investigate the discontinuity of the Jacobian.
We first note that the Jacobian of all three parts of the map, although 3 × 3 in
dimension, behaves like identity on the third co-ordinate, the time. Hence it is
essentially a 2 × 2 determinant. And it has been shown by Banerjee and Grebogi that any 2−D map can, by means of a suitable co-ordinate transformation,
be written in the form:
M=

a
c

=

Tr ( M)
1
−det( M) 0

From (1.44) and (1.45) it can be easily shown that
det( JN1 ) = e−γτ , det( JN2 ) = e−γ(T −τ )
Also, from (1.38),
det( JZDM ) = 1
Therefore it is evident the determinant of the Poincaré map does not suffer
any discontinuity.
Now we will look at the trace.
Using (1.40):

Therefore

(1.48)
Obviously, α is the only term that contains the singularity term in the form

According to our Claim 1.3.1, when the two frequencies are at these exact

1.4.3

Impact map

Consider the impact oscillator system described by (1.10)
¨ = −γ x
˙ − k1 x + G (t)
mx

( x, v) → ( x, −rv)

for x < σ

(1.56)

for x = σ

(1.57)

Where r is the coefficient of restitution.
In such a system, quite often periodic orbits are observed which involve
one or more impacts at the hard wall at x = σ. For simplicity, let’s consider
orbits with only one collision. Clearly, one necessary condition for such orbits
to exist is:
(σ, v) nT
→ ( σ, − v/r )
Where nT is the time period of the orbit. This map is known as the impact map. For a stable orbit, apart from this equation, the Jacobian should
have eigenvalues with absolute values < 1. This approach was used in [3,
Ch. 2; p. 20], where they obtained the necessary conditions for saddle-node
and period-doubling grazing bifurcations to occur in impact oscillators without damping.

Impact map formalism was also used in past to study chattering [29], intermittency close to resonance [30], stability and bifurcation of single collision
orbits [31–33] and multiple collision orbits [34, 35]. However, it has not yet
been used to study the vanishing of chaos near n ∈ N for impact oscillators
with damping.

1.4.4

Numerical computation of fixed points

The method of impact map works very well to solve for periodic orbits involving only one collision per cycle (termed PnC1 orbits)4 with the hard wall. But
this method does not work well for parameters values for which stable orbits
collide multiple times in a single cycle. Ma et al. devised a way to numerically
compute [36, 37] any stable or unstable PnCm orbit. We explain the method
below.
For simplicity, we supposing the orbit crosses the border only once, although the strength of this approach is in finding more complicated orbits.
Such an orbit is depicted in Fig 1.13. Then finding out the orbit boils down to
finding out the solution to this set of equations:
x1 = ϕ1 ( x0 , 0, τ0 )
H ( x1 ) = 0

(1.58)
(1.59)

x2 = ϕ2 ( x1 , τ0 , τ1 )
H ( x2 ) = 0

(1.60)
(1.61)

x0 = ϕ1 ( x2 , τ1 , T − τ0 − τ1 )

(1.62)

This is a set of 3n + 2 equations in 3n + 2 unknowns, so this can be tackled
with standard Newton’s method [38, 39] of root finding:
y n +1 =
4 In

G (yn )
¯n )
J (y

general, PmCn orbit means period-m orbits with n collisions per cycle

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

22

Here y := { x0 , x1 , x2 , τ0 , τ1 } is a 3n + 2 dimensional vector.
Thus we can use the standard methods of stability analysis by evaluating
the eigenvalues of the Jacobian at the fixed points.

1.4.5

Lifetime of transients

The problem of long lived transients plagues many nonlinear systems. Despite the existence of a stable fixed point, trajectories starting from many initial
conditions are found to take a lot of time to reach the fixed point. In case of
discrete time systems involving grazing, Grebogi et al. [40, 41] predicted that in
a system where grazing occurs at parameter value ρ = ρc , average transient
lifetimes vary as
τ ∝ | ρ − ρc |−γ

(1.63)

Where the value γ is called the critical transient of the system. They derived
an analytical expression for γ in terms of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian at the
fixed points of the system. Experimental verification of their prediction was
carried out by [42, 43].

1.5

Scope of present work

As we described in Subsection 1.4.2, Banerjee et al. predicted by calculating
the ZDM that chaos through on border collision route should not happen in
soft impacting oscillators if 2ω g /ω ∈ N. The same analysis was found out to
hold for hard impacting oscillators in [25], Experimental results were found to
match this prediction very well. However, chaos was seen to vanish not only
when n were exactly integers, but in a small neighbourhood of each of them.
So far, no explanation for this has been published. In the next chapter, we will
take up this problem.
During our simulations on hard impacting oscillators, we observed transients orders of magnitude longer than what should take place in a corresponding system without the nonlinearity imposed by the impacts. No study on
transient lifetimes in impacting systems had been published so far. It needs
to be checked if the results of Grebogi et al. [40], derived for maps, holds true
for continuous time impacting systems or not and if it does, whether a way to
compute the critical exponent could be devised.

Chapter 2

Our system
As promised in the last chapter, we will now investigate two problems: the
vanishing of chaos in hard impacting oscillator and the problem of long transients in the same system.

2.1

We briefly describe our system again.

unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Solution disregarding the boundary

If we forget the boundary for a moment, the equation of motion is a nonhomogeneous ODE. As usual, its solution is a sum total of a homogeneous solution and a particular solution [44, p. 23-3]:

Approximate Poincaré map

In this section we will make an attempt to derive an expression for a Poincaré
map for our system assuming PnC1 orbits. Suppose the parameters of the system are set such that √ 2 F/m
= σ . This constitutes a steady state

grazing orbit. Suppose we look at stroboscopic time slices such that the grazing orbit grazes the boundary at t = τ. Now we perturb the system slightly so
that the system hits the boundary with some non zero velocity at t = τ + δt
Therefore we have:

(2.7)

(2.8)

With the definition
x (t) = x (t) − x p (t)
Now we draw attention to the fact that in the Poincaré map (2.8) , the second term is the actual nonlinear term.
If we can find expressions for δt, v p , vh in terms of x (0), v(0), the job will
be done. This can easily be done provided that the trajectory collides with the
wall at very low velocity. We provide the calculations in Appendix A.
Using this Poincaré map, we plotted the bifurcation diagrams Fig 2.2 and
2ω
Fig 2.3. They clearly demonstrates the curious effect of making n = ω g an
integer on grazing bifurcations. In the non-integral case, as [21, 25] predicts,
there is a chaotic region. But for n = 2, no such thing happens. Instead we see
two fixed points immediately gaining stability.

2.3

Numerical computation of the fixed points

We see that in case of both integral n and non-integral n, periodic orbits became
stable a little bit after grazing. We decided to take a look at the phase space

trajectories. One such trajectory in case of n = 2 is plotted in Fig 2.4
As we can clearly see, this is a closed orbit involving a single collision. The
time period is 2T = 2 2π
ω . Therefore the Newton-Raphson method described in
Subsection 1.4.4 would work fine for stability analysis of such orbits.

2.3.1

The procedure

We start by defining a 5-dim vector y = ( x0 , v0 , xc , vc , τ ), where τ is the time
when a trajectory starting from ( x, v) = ( x0 , v0 ) collide with the hard wall and
( x, v) = ( xc , vc ) at that time.

Then we get a system of equations G(y) = 0 where:
G1,2 (y) = x1 − ϕ(τ, 0, x0 ) = 0
G3,4 (y) = x0 − ϕ(2T, τ, x1 ) = 0
G5 (y) = x1 − σ = 0
Since this is a set of 5 equations in 5 unknowns, we can solve the equation
G (y) = 0 using Newton-Raphson method:
y n +1 = y n + J ( y ) −1 G ( y )
The solution will provide us with a P2C1 orbit. It should be noted that this
method will give stable and unstable orbits, unlike normal simulations which
will never give us unstable orbits. However, in order to get all existing orbits, one must run the program with many initial conditions to ensure that the
Newton-Raphson iteration scheme ‘finds’ all the solutions.
In Fig 2.5 , we plot the results of such numerical calculation in the case of
n = 2.235 and n = 2. We can easily see that in the first case (n ∈
/ N), when F
is quite larger than the grazing condition (Which is F = 0.3903, to be exact), all
the eigenvalues are < 1 in magnitude. But as the F value approaches grazing ,
the absolute value of one or more eigenvalues of the fixed point exceeds 1. We
know from basic dynamical systems theory that this signifies the transition of
the fixed point from attractor to repeller (if the magnitudes of both eigenvalues
turn > 1) or saddle (if the magnitude of only one eigenvalue turn > 1).

However, in the case of n = 2, as opposed to the previous case, no transition
of the fixed point from an attractor to saddle/repeller takes place here: the
eigenvalue stays put < 1 throughout the range of parameter values. This again,
provides a justification for the vanishing of chaos as predicted in [21] .
However, there are a few problems in the Newton-Raphson approach of
stability analysis. First of all, the numerically computed eigenvalues fluctuate
a lot near grazing, possibly due to numerical errors in the Newton-Raphson iteration scheme. Secondly, it does not provide us with analytical expressions for
either the fixed points or the eigenvalues, making the task of gaining physical
insights into the problem much more difficult.
Therefore we decide to explore another approach for studying the same
phenomena.

2.4

Impact map and its Jacobian

We had described the concept of impact maps in subsection 1.4.3. Now we will
apply it in order to tackle the problem of stability analysis of single collision
orbits in hard impacting oscillators.

Derivation of the map

Suppose the oscillator collides against the hard wall at time τ and the state
x − (τ )
vector immediately before collision be
. Just after the collision, the
v− (τ )
state vector becomes
x + (τ )
x + (τ )
=
+
−v+ (τ )
v (τ )
By construction, x − (τ ) = x + (τ ) = σ. Then we have:

The uncertainty about the ± sign is a direct consequence of the fact that for

Fixed points of the map

Therefore the fixed points of M I and the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of M I at
those fixed points will determine whether a PmC1 orbit will be stable or not.
Suppose

x = ax − bv ± 2bω

(2.15)

v can be easily eliminated:
v(1 + d) − cx
x (1 − a) + bv
=

bv = x (d − ad + bc)
Substituting in (2.15):
x ( a − d + ad − bc − 1) ± 2bω

Then:
A2 − ( σ − x )2 = α2 x 2
x2 (α2 + 1) − 2σx + (σ2 − A2 ) = 0
Therefore we have the solution:

(2.17)
(2.18)

One important property of (2.17) is very evident: At grazing, A = σ. Therefore there exists a trivial solution: ( x ∗ , v∗ ) = (0, 0). This, of course, corresponds
to a non-colliding orbit. Now, after grazing, two solutions exist simultaneously.
The question is, are they attractors, repellers or saddles? This is the question
we will tackle next.

In Fig 2.7, we plot the eigenvalues of the Jacobian at the fixed points obtained via Formula (2.17) against the driving force amplitude for various n values. We observe that for n = 2.01, all the eigenvalues at both the fixed points
remain always < 1 in magnitude, even right after grazing. This means that
both the fixed points are attractors.
However, for n = 2.1, one fixed point is an attractors throughout the whole
range of parameter values. However, another one is a saddle and one of its
eigenvalues shoots up as the system approaches grazing, signifying high stretching of the phase space.
In case of n = 2.2, both of them are repellers. Only near grazing, one of
them become a saddle.

CHAPTER 2. OUR SYSTEM

Stability analysis at grazing

Now we are very close to determining the narrow window of disappearing
chaos as predicted in [21]. As we have seen in Fig 2.3, when the value of n is
close to a positive integer, a stable orbit emerges right after grazing. Looking
at the trajectories, we have seen that it is indeed a P1C1 orbit. Therefore the
window of vanishing chaos will be equal to the range of n values where there
exists an attracting fixed point of the impact map M I right after grazing.

From (2.17), we can easily get the fixed points for any parameter values .

A glance at (2.19) tells us that the Jacobian has a singular term at the fixed

orbit will be stable for a certain set of parameter values or not.
In Fig. 2.8 we look at the nature of the fixed point p2 of impact map for
various n values. We clearly see that around each n ∈ N, ∃ a neighbourhood
(shaded in dark green in the figure), where both the eigenvalues of the Jacobian
are < 1 in magnitude. The neighbourhoods are much narrower about odd n
values than they are about even n values. We also note that the neighbourhood
expands in width as n increases.

2.5

Long transients

It has previously been observed that in a system exhibiting grazing bifurcations, the time spent by it before settling down to its attractor follows a power
law pattern, with a blow up at the parameter value for grazing. We have observed similar results in case of the system investigated in the last section, as
depicted in Fig 2.9 and Fig 2.10.

We point out here that these extra long lived transients are totally artefacts
of the nonlinearity imposed by the impacts. Because without the impacts, the
transient solution (which we have been calling homogeneous solution so far),
goes as

Therefore the transient lifetimes, if the effect of impacts is disregarded,
should be inversely proportional to γ and should not depend on F at all. Therefore, in order to explain these long lived transients, we would need to concentrate on the impacts.

In this limit, the plot of x vs. t looks almost like beats. It is not surprising
since (2.3) is a superposition of two frequencies after all. But since the amplitude associated with the frequency is decaying exponentially with time, at
t → ∞ limit it will reduce to − A cos ωt.
In general, the sum of two different sine waves differing both in amplitude
and frequency cannot be further simplified. However, an approximate envelope can be calculated.
We demonstrate this in Fig 2.12.
The trajectory:
x (t) = − A cos ωt + e−γt/2 B cos ω g t + C

(2.23)

Calculation of collision-free area
Now we are in a position to make a quantitative measurement of how “collisionprone” the system is for a certain fixed parameter value. What we need to do
is:
1. Consider a large number of initial conditions ( x0 , v0 ) ∈ R2 .
2. Using the envelope, predict if there will be any future collision or not if
the system starts from that initial condition.

CHAPTER 2. OUR SYSTEM

39

3. Points for which there is no further collision should form a closed area in
the whole space.
4. See how this area shrinks as we approach grazing.
Now we will define a few quantities to be used heavily in future.
Definition 2.5.1. Em = height of the next peak of the envelope.
Definition 2.5.2. xm = height of the next peak of the trajectory 3
Definition 2.5.3. µ xv = {( x, v) ∈ X × V : xm ( x, v) < σ }
Directly from this definition, µ xv can be calculated by the Monte Carlo integration approach. In Fig 2.15 we show how µ xv varies with F and γ respectively.
We see very clearly in Fig 2.15 that µ xv varies with both F and γ following
power law patterns:
µ xv ∝ | F − Fc |2
µ xv ∝ |γ − γc |

(2.35)

6.15

(2.36)

So far, we have calculated µ xv by means of a Monte Carlo integration: we
chose N initial points, evaluated the number n of them that does not lead to

to µ xv .

Now we’ll try an analytical approach.
µ xv =

Since C is a rapidly varying function of both x and v and has range {−π/2, π/2},
we can replace C ≈ 0 without too much error.

Now it needs to be seen how good the approximations involved in deriving
the analytical expression (2.38) were. In Fig 2.16, we plot values of µ xv using the
analytical formula and the values obtained by Monte Carlo integration using
100000 points against F. As we can see, the approximation overestimate µ xv
only slightly.

CHAPTER 2. OUR SYSTEM

42

Relationship between µ xv and transient lifetime
We see from Fig 2.15 that µ xv varies with parameters F and γ following a power
law pattern: far from grazing, the area is large; implying plenty of chance of the
system to go to a stable non-grazing orbit. However, as the parameter is tuned
towards grazing, this area sharply drops to zero; which results in frequent collisions with the boundary even though there exists a non-grazing stable orbit.
So the system takes a long time to “find” that elusive stable orbit, resulting in
long transient lifetimes.
This immediately suggests that the transient lifetime τ may be related to
µvx according to:
τ∝

1
+ τ0
µ

(2.39)

This hypothesis is further strengthened by the fact that both µ xv and τ have
been seen to follow power law pattern. We have already seen in Fig 2.15 that
µ xv varies with F and γ following a power law pattern with exponents 2 and
6.15 respectively. Now we will check if the exponents for τ turns out to be −1
times the exponent for µvx or not.
In Fig 2.17, we have fitted the function a| Fc − F |−2 + b to our τ vs. F data
and observed quite good fit.
However, the fit of the function a|γ − γc |−6.15 + b with our τ vs. γ data
turned out to be not so good. There is a sharp decrease in τ near grazing as
well as can be easily seen in the plot. We have looked into the matter and
found out that for the parameter values used for generating this plot, when
γ is very near grazing, a P3C1 orbit gains stability a little bit before grazing,
in addition to the expected P1C0 one. This causes the sharp decline in τ just
before grazing, because the newborn orbit has a large basin of attraction and a
much shorter average transient lifetime. We believe this has affected the fit of
τ vs. γ curve as well. This, of course, will need to be checked by taking many
initial conditions for each value of γ and plotting the average τ over only the
initial conditions leading to the P1C0 orbit.

2.6

Conclusion

In this thesis, we have explored two separate aspects of the impact oscillator
system. The first one was that of vanishing chaos when the ratio of the damped
natural frequency of the oscillator and the frequency of the driving force is in
the neighbourhood of certain discrete values. So far, no analytical method for
determining what these neighbourhoods are has been published. Using the
impact map formalism, we have done that. This is extremely helpful to know
these neighbourhoods in actual physical systems because it will enable one to
set system parameters in a way so that chaos is avoided.

The second problem we tackled is that of extra long transient times. This is
a very important problem for experimenters because in every experiment one
can afford to spend a finite amount of time for each measurement. Extra long
transient times can make experiments cumbersome at best and non-viable at
worst. We have attempted to explain the way these lifetimes change with any
parameter of the system.

Appendix A

Calculations for approximate
Poincaré map
In (2.8), there were a few unknown variables whose analytical expressions in
the regime of low velocity collisions needed to be determined. We proceed to
do so now:
Let the parameters be such that the stable orbit grazes slightly: xm ({ parameters}) =
σ + ε.
Now start from an initial condition such that | x (0)| = 0. (Exactly on the
stable orbit).
Then we have:
